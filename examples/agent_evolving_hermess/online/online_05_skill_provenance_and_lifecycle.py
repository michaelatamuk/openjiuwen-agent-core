"""Example 08 — Skill provenance tracking and full lifecycle management.

Demonstrates the Hermess-style features added to skill_store and provenance:

  1. background_review_context() — marks skill writes as 'agent'-created
  2. get_write_origin() — reads the current ContextVar value
  3. UsageSidecar / skill_get_usage() — per-skill telemetry (.usage.json)
  4. skill_set_pinned() — pin protection blocks delete/archive
  5. skill_archive() / skill_restore() — reversible deactivation
  6. skill_list(include_archived=True) — see all skills including archived
  7. skill_delete(absorbed_into=...) — consolidation-intent tracking

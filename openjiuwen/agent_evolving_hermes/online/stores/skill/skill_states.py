"""SKILL.md filesystem operations.

Mirrors Hermes skill_manager_tool.py internal helpers.
Handles concurrent access with per-skill asyncio locks and atomic writes.

New vs original implementation:
  - UsageSidecar dataclass (.usage.json per skill) with full telemetry
  - Lifecycle states: SKILL_STATE_ACTIVE / STALE / ARCHIVED
  - skill_delete() with absorbed_into consolidation-intent tracking
  - skill_archive() / skill_restore() for reversible deactivation
  - skill_get_usage() / skill_set_pinned() helpers
  - skill_create() records write origin from provenance ContextVar
  - skill_list() filters archived skills by default
